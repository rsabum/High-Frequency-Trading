    "### Problem Formulation\n",
    "The algorithm seeks to optimize the bid ask spread for each time $t \\lt T$ such that the net Profit and Loss of trading the spread is maximized at the end of the trading session time $T$. We also want to control the algorithm for excessive risk taking during the trading session. Thus, we impose two penalties: (1) running inventory penalty for trading too large exposures during the trading session, and (2) terminal inventory penalty i.e. holding non-zero inventory at the end of the trading day.  Mathematically, the maximization of stochastic system subject to the penalties is equivalent to maximizing the following objective:\n",

    "#### Mid Price\n",
    "The mid price is modeled by a Bachelier process, a continuous-time stochastic process characterized by a normal distribution of price changes. Specifically, the mid price $S_t$ evolves according to the stochastic differential equation:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "dS_t = \\mu \\, dt + \\sigma \\, dW_t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\mu$ represents the drift, or the average rate of price change over time, $\\sigma$ denotes the volatility, capturing the standard deviation of price fluctuations, and $W_t$ is a standard Wiener process modeling the random shocks. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Incoming Order Flow\n",
    "Incoming market orders at the mid price are represented via two poisson processes with parameters $\\lambda^\\text{b}$ and $\\lambda^\\text{s}$. Additionally, the further away we quote from the mid price, the less likely we are to find incoming orders. Therefore, we use the following functions to model orderflow decay as we move further away from the mid price:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\lambda_t^\\text{b}(\\delta_t^\\text{b}) &= \\lambda^\\text{b} e^{-\\kappa^\\text{b}\\delta_t^\\text{b}} \\\\\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Inventory Process\n",
    "The inventory process is modeled by two independent Poisson processes representing the arrival of buy and sell orders. The change in inventory at any time $t$, denoted by $dQ_t$, evolves as the difference between the cumulative number of buy orders and sell orders at time $t$:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Cash Process\n",
    "The cash process tracks the net earnings from executed trades on both the ask and bid sides, incorporating both the revenue from selling and the costs from buying, along with a rebate for each executed trade. Let the price at which a market maker sells (ask) be denoted by $S_t + \\delta^\\text{a}$ and the price at which they buy (bid) by $S_t - \\delta^\\text{b}$. The change in the cash process at time $t$, denoted by $dX_t$, is given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "dX_t = (S_t + \\delta^\\text{a} + \\epsilon)dN_t^\\text{a} - (S_t - \\delta^\\text{b} + \\epsilon)dN_t^\\text{b}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "with $N_t^\\text{a}$ and $N_t^\\text{b}$ representing the number of sell and buy orders, respectively, and $\\epsilon$ is the rebate earned for each executed trade. This process accounts for the gains from selling at the ask, the costs from buying at the bid, and the cumulative rebates from providing liquidity.\n"
