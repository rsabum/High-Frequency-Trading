In this project we use Stochastic Calculus, Finite Difference Methods, and Asynchronous Dynamic Programming to optimize the quoting and hedging strategy of a market maker faced with running and terminal inventory penalties. Resulting model was tested in 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations achieving an average return of 20% higher than the underlying asset. To learn more, view [notebook.ipynb](notebook.ipynb).
